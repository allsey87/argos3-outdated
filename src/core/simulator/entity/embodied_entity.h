    * This entity is a link to a body in the physics engine.

    * The embodied entity can either be a root entity (i.e., parentless), or a component.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Its main purpose is to serve as an interface to the actual body in the physics engine.
    * Sensors can use embodied entities to know the position and orientations of the objects
    * in the arena, and can perform ray-cast queries to test for occlusions.
    * In addition, the method MoveTo() allows one to move an entity and/or rotate it.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Embodied entities can be either <em>movable</em> or <em>non-movable</em>.
    * Movable entities are typically self-propelled objects such as mobile robots,
    * or passive objects that can be grasped and moved around. A movable entity
    * can only be associated to a single physics engine per time. Non-movable
    * embodied entities are typically the structural elements of the environments
    * (walls, columns, etc.) and can be associated to multiple physics engines.
